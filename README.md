# Data_Strucutures

Computer Science course taken in Fall 2018.

Objectives: The goal of the course is to introduce concepts and techniques from data structures that are widely used in Computer Science. The student will be designing and implementing more complex data structures using the basic data structures. The class also provides some algorithm design and analysis techniques to handle these data structure

Textbooks : Data Structures, Algorithms, and Applications in Java, Second Edition by Sartaj Sahni, Silicon Press, 2005.</br>
Data Abstraction and Problem Solving with Java, Third Edition by Janet Prichard and Frank M. Carrano, Pearson, 2011.


Java OOP Assignments:</br>
Assign 1.</br>
Implementation of an interactive programme that uses Linked list data structure in order to store data. Do the same thing with array list implementation and compare those two.</br>
Assign 2.</br>
Rat in a maze problem.  Shortest Path Maze Solver & Longest Path Maze Solver.</br>
Assign 3.</br>
Q1) Input a string of preorder, construct binary tree, and report postorder, inorder, and levelorder versions. Q2) Longest Common Path of two given nodes in a binary tree.</br>
Assing 4.</br>
Implement a variety of sorting algorithms and compare their performances. 1) Selection sort, 2) Quicksort, 3) Heapsort, without using `heap initialization', 4) Heapsort using heap initialization 5) using a binary search tree (insert the numbers into an initially empty binary search tree, and report the numbers in in-order) 6) using a splay tree 7) Merge sort</br>
Assign 5.</br>
Construct a graph of a given grid graph of size 20Ã—20, with 40 vertices removed. Use Dijkstra algorithm to figure out a shortest path and Prim's algorithm to acquire the minimum spanning tree. </br>
