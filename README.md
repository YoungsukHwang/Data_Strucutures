# Data_Strucutures

Computer Science course taken in Fall 2018.

Objectives: The goal of the course is to introduce concepts and techniques from data structures that are widely used in Computer Science. The student will be designing and implementing more complex data structures using the basic data structures. The class also provides some algorithm design and analysis techniques to handle these data structure
